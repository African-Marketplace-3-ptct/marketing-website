                    <h2>Donny Rodriguez</h2>
                    <p>Hi! Donny Here. I remember the first time that I saw some code. I passed by a magazine called "Web Designer" in Barnes and Noble and curiosity got the best of me. I picked it up, flipped through some pages and saw a demo on how to make a hamburger menu.  I thought "This is how the internet is made?". I was thoroughly intrigued. I bought the magazine, drove home, and on an old MacBook from college I copied the code line by line and viola: The Hamburger Menu appeared on my screen. I was hooked. Later-on I joined a program called "Lambda School", so I could continue to learn the skills I need to become a web developer full-time and make even more cool stuff on the web. This website is a project that I and some of my colleagues worked on over the course of two weeks. Enjoy!</p>
