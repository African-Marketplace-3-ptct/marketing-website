                    <p> When you come in the shop, it's like you are not in LA anymore. The look of the tiny spot they have inside and out is really shabby, could use some TLC, and the smell was so strong inside so if you are not used to the strong African spice smell, beware. They have good products though! Giant red palm oil container that's like 25bucks and some other stuffs that taste authentic! When you come in the shop, it's like you are not in LA anymore.
